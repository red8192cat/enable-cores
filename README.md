 Usage: enable-cores [number of cores you want to set to active; all the other cores will be disabled]
 Examples: enable-cores 2

 It automatically detects your number of cores (threads) in the system, so you just can't mess up with a wrong number :) 
 Don't be scared, try any number you want! The first core cannot be disabled anyway, so you can't break the system. 

 In the repo, there is the script and the binary (compiled on debian 12). You can put the binary into /usr/local/sbin
